Jupyter Notebook for "Data-Driven Neural Networks for Windkessel Parameter Calibration"
========================================================================================

How to install:

- Prerequisites:
  - jupyter-notebook, recommended voila (browser-based viewer for jupyter-notebooks, giving a nicer interface)
  - Python environment with
    - tensorflow and keras
    - IPython
    - ipywidgets
  Current versions should work, but there is no guarantee.

- Clone or download the files to a local copy where you keep the relative path structure
- Run a terminal session, go to the main folder, and run the notebook 'notebook_windkessel.ipynb' in jupyter-notebook or in voila:
  jupyter-notebook notebook_windkessel.ipynb     OR
  voila notebook_windkessel.ipynb

  Important: if you use voila, you might have to copy and paste the local URL of the notebook session manually in the address bar of your browser. The URL should have the form 'http://localhost:8866/' or similar.

- Click the buttons (and run the cells in jupyter-notebook) to perform different calibration tasks.
